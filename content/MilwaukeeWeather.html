<p>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association weather station at General Mitchell International Airport hasn’t missed a daily weather report since 1941. These graphs show 2020 cumulative preciptiation, daily high temperature, and daily low compared to the past 79 years of weather reports at General Mitchell. The graphs show 2020 weather data through 2020-08-12. The code was last run on 2020-08-14.</p>
<p>Climatological normals were calculated by NOAA over the period 1981-2010. The record values presented in these graphs are simply the records recorded from 1941 through 2019 at this specific weather station. They are not necessarily the same as NOAA’s official daily records for Milwaukee, which combine multiple weather stations and cover a longer period of time. Those are <a href="https://www.weather.gov/mkx/normal-records-mke_msn">available here</a>.</p>
