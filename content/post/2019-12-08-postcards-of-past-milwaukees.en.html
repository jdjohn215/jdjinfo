<p>I bought these postcards at a <a href="https://milwaukeehistory.net/">Milwaukee County Historical Society</a> book sale. They are in three categories: the Washington Park Zoo, Milwaukee parks, and miscellaneous.</p>

<h2>The Washington Park Zoo</h2>
<p><strong>Barless Bear Den, Washington Park, Milwaukee, Wis</strong></p>
<p>Date: postmarked August 16, 1940 in Milwaukee</p>
<p>Printed text: “Rising 15 to 18 ft., the walls of irregular naturalistic formation, have at the base a moat, 15 ft .wide, scarcely visible from the public walk. The bears standing on the extreme edge of the moat stare at the crowds only some 18 ft. distant. Unique groups of Polar, Grizzly, Black Bears and Wolves here enjoy practical freedom. The swimming pool is 15x30 ft. An inner den, 7x30 ft. is provided for sleeping and hibernating.”

<p><strong>Azalea Show – Japanese Garden. - Mitchell Park Horticultural Conservatory</strong></p>
<p>Date: not postmarked, the format of the card suggests a later date than the Grant Park and Lake Park cards</p>

<h2>Miscellaneous</h2>
<p><strong>The Dam, Milwaukee River, Milwaukee</strong></p>
<p>Date: the postmark is illegible, but it has a 1 cent series 1902 stamp</p>
