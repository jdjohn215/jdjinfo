I bought these postcards at a [Milwaukee County Historical Society](https://milwaukeehistory.net/) book sale. They are in three categories: the Washington Park Zoo, Milwaukee parks, and miscellaneous.  

## The Washington Park Zoo

**Barless Bear Den, Washington Park, Milwaukee, Wis**

Date: postmarked August 16, 1940 in Milwaukee

Printed text: "Rising 15 to 18 ft., the walls of irregular naturalistic formation, have at the base a moat, 15 ft .wide, scarcely visible from the public walk. The bears standing on the extreme edge of the moat stare at the crowds only some 18 ft. distant. Unique groups of Polar, Grizzly, Black Bears and Wolves here enjoy practical freedom. The swimming pool is 15x30 ft. An inner den, 7x30 ft. is provided for sleeping and hibernating."

**Sheep Mountain, Washington Park Zoo, Milwaukee, Wis**

Date: not postmarked, but appears to be the same age at the "Barless Bear Den", ca 1940

Printed text: "5,000 tons of Lannon Stone were used for building this miniature mountain, 236 feet long, 118 feet wide, height 27 feet; contains a feed room 50 by 18 feet, a stairway leading to the upper part of the hill for distribution of food. Narrow paths are provided, intercepted with crevises and jutting crags. Water falls in a cascade down the south side of the hill into a small lagoon."

**Gordon Park as Seen from Riverside Park, Milwaukee, Wis.**

**Azalea Show -- Japanese Garden. - Mitchell Park Horticultural Conservatory**

Date: not postmarked, the format of the card suggests a later date than the Grant Park and Lake Park cards

## Miscellaneous

**The Dam, Milwaukee River, Milwaukee**

Date: the postmark is illegible, but it has a 1 cent series 1902 stamp

I'm not sure what location this is, perhaps somewhere near North Avenue?

**Public Library and Museum, Milwaukee, Wis.**

Date: not postmarked, but appears to be part of the same series as the park postcards from the late 1940s and 1950s

Printed text: "The library contains approximately 900,000 volumes for free use of the entire public for home circulation and for study use. The Museum exhibits a magnificent collection of historical relics and scientific curios."
