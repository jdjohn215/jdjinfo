<p>This table shows the share of workers in each occupational category with a bachelorâ€™s degree, along with the top three most common degrees for each job. I built the table using over 7 million interviews from the 2014-18 American Community Survey, but occupations with very small numbers of college degree holders nonetheless have large margins of error for the most common college degrees.</p>
