<p>This maps shows 2018 year-to-date rainfall compared to the normal amount (as calculated by NOAA from 1981-2010). Counties colored blue have received more than the usual rainfall so far. Red counties have received less.</p>
<p>If you’d like to replicate the first map, check out <a href="https://johndjohnson.info/2018/09/14/rainfall-maps-code/"><strong>the code</strong></a>. Warning: it takes a <em>long</em> time to run.</p>

<p>After making this county-level map, it occured to me that political boundaries might not be the best way to represent this sort of natural phenomenon.</p>
<p>Here is another version of the map, but this time the geographic level used are watersheds.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
