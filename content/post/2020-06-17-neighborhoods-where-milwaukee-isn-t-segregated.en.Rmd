Milwaukee's pervasive segregation is infamous, but it doesn't extend everywhere. [Brown Universityâ€™s American Communities Project](https://s4.ad.brown.edu/Projects/Diversity/SegSorting/Default.aspx) ranked the metro in 2010 as 2nd in Black/white segregation, 13th in Latino/white segregation, and 116th in Asian/white segregation. The metro area includes all of Milwaukee County plus neighboring, Ozaukee, Washington, and Waukesha counties, but the situation is scarcely better [within city limits](https://s4.ad.brown.edu/Projects/Diversity/SegCitySorting/Default.aspx). In fact it's worse for Latino/white and Asian/white segregation. The City of Milwaukee ranked 10th in Black/white segregation, 8th in Latino/white segregation, and 16th in Asian/white segregation.

Still, not all of Milwaukee's neighborhoods are characterized by racial segregation. Among [Milwaukee's 186 neighborhoods](https://city.milwaukee.gov/Neighborhoods), 73 have a Black majority, 72 have a white majority, 14 are majority Latino, and 27 have no majority group. I calculated these statistics by (dis)aggregating data from the 2018 5-year American Community Survey into neighborhood boundaries using [the methodology described here](https://github.com/jdjohn215/Milwaukee-Geo-Crosswalks). Similarily, Piggsville (also called "The Valley") has 36% Black residents, 34% white, 16% Latino, and 11% Asian.

The 27 neighborhoods without a majority group are, arranged in descending order by total population, `r paste(no.majority)`.

The most integrated neighborhoods are Little Menomonee Parkway (on the Northwest side) and Piggsville (near Miller Park). The residents of Little Menomonee Parkway are 35% Black, 35% white, 15% Latino, 8% something else, and 7% Asian.

The statistics for each neighborhood are presented in the table below.

```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
d %>%
  filter(race != "native") %>%
  mutate(race = str_to_title(race),
         neighborhood = str_to_title(neighborhood),
         total_pop = round(total_pop)) %>%
  select(-pop) %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = race, values_from = pct) %>%
  mutate(`All others` = (100 - Asian - Black - Latino - White)) %>%
  mutate_if(is.numeric, round) %>%
  rename("Total pop." = 2,
         "Neighborhood" = 1) %>%
  reactable(striped = TRUE,
            showPageSizeOptions = TRUE,
            filterable = TRUE,
            sortable = TRUE,
            columns = list(
              `Total pop.` = colDef(format = colFormat(separators = TRUE)),
              Asian = colDef(format = colFormat(suffix = "%")),
              Black = colDef(format = colFormat(suffix = "%")),
              Latino = colDef(format = colFormat(suffix = "%")),
              White = colDef(format = colFormat(suffix = "%")),
              `All others` = colDef(format = colFormat(suffix = "%"))
            ))
```
