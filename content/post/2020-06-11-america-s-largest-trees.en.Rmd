The largest tree of its species is called a "Champion Tree." The nonprofit American Forests has run a [competition to identify national champion trees](https://www.americanforests.org/get-involved/americas-biggest-trees/) in the United States for the past 80 years. This map shows the locations of each tree in 2019.

Just four states--North Dakota, South Dakota, Rhode Island, and Wisconsin--have no champion trees. Florida has the most (106), followed by Virginia (90), Texas (77) and Arizona and California (both 58).
