<p>This gif shows snow depths at every U.S. weather station on each day from July 1, 2017 to June 30, 2018. Blue dots indicate snow on the ground; the size of the dot represents the depth of the snow. The faint, small tan dots represent weather stations.</p>
<p>All data is from NOAA. Strange outliers may be data entry errors.</p>
