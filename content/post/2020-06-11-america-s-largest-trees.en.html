<p>The largest tree of its species is called a “Champion Tree.” The nonprofit American Forests has run a <a href="https://www.americanforests.org/get-involved/americas-biggest-trees/">competition to identify national champion trees</a> in the United States for the past 80 years. This map shows the locations of each tree in 2019.</p>
<p>Just four states–North Dakota, South Dakota, Rhode Island, and Wisconsin–have no champion trees. Florida has the most (106), followed by Virginia (90), Texas (77) and Arizona and California (both 58).</p>
