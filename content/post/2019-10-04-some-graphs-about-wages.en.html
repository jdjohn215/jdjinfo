<p>The following graphs explore <strong>wages</strong> at different levels of education in the United States. It’s important to understand that these <strong>are not depicting income for all people holding these degrees.</strong> Instead, they are showing the wages (or salaries) earned by people who work full time.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> People who only work part time or who don’t work at all are excluded as well as people who aren’t paid for their work.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> I’m also leaving out income from sources besides work.</p>
<p><strong>Education affects earnings a lot, and the magnitude increases with age.</strong>
This first graph simply shows the median earnings for people with different degrees at each year of their life from age 25 to 70.</p>
<p>At age 25, a high school graduate makes $4,200 more than someone without that diploma. An Associate’s degree holder brings home $4,600 more than the high school grad. Having a bachelor’s degree earns $8,900 over the 2-year degree. A Master’s tacks on $3,700 more than an BA. The doctoral degree improves over the MA by $7,900. The 25 year-old holder of a professional degree is just starting their career and can actually expect to earn slightly less than someone with just a Bachelor’s, but this will change very quickly.</p>
<p>With the exception of professional degree holders, the relative ranks of all these degree holders will be unchanged at age 55, but the differences between their wages will have skyrocketed. A worker without a high school diploma (or eqivalent) will earn just $28,000. The HS graduate will make $38,000. The Associate’s degree holder will have just about reached the level of a 25 year-old doctor, earning $51,000 a year. The median college Bachelor will make $70,500. The Master’s degree holder draws $81,000; the Doctor $103,400; and the Professional $124,300.</p>

<p>The numbers in the graph above are just median values. Most people make either more or less than that number–sometimes by a considerable amount. The next two graphs show the <em>distribution</em> of earnings for people with a high school degree, a BA, and a doctorate in each state.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> The first graph shows early-career earners (ages 25-35), while the second shows mid-career salaries (ages 40-54). In each graph, the labelled dots show median values.</p>

<p>Early-career high school degree holders make the least, on average, in Mississippi where the median income is $25,000. They make the most in North Dakota, where the median income is $34,700. Bachelor’s degree holders also make the least in Mississippi ($36,800); they earn the most in the District of Columbia ($61,300). Among states where an estimate was possible, holders of a doctorate made the least in Indiana ($56,900) and the most in New Jersey ($84,000).</p>
<p><img src="/post/2019-10-04-some-graphs-about-wages.en_files/StateFacetsMidCareer.png" /></p>
<p>Mississippi is still the worst for mid-career high school degree holders. The average worker will earn just $31,600. New Jersey and Connecticut (not North Dakota) tie for the best at $46,000. Among those with a Bachelor’s, South Dakota ($49,000) edges out Mississippi ($50,000) for the bottom spot. The District of Columbia retains its hold on first place with a median mid-career salary of $100,000. Mid-career doctorate degree holders make the least in Kentucky ($74,600) and the most in D.C. ($123,000).</p>

<li id="fn1"><p>Following the Affordable Care Act, I define “full-time employment” as at least 30 hours per week. I choose not to normalize wages and salaries by hours worked because I think the number of hours worked (among workers who have already achieved full-time employment) reflects a variety of complicated factors including hours available, lifestyle choices, and industry expectations.<a href="#fnref1" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn2"><p>Some people report themselves as working many hours per week but receiving no income. This could be because they are self-employed or work for a family business without drawing a salary.<a href="#fnref2" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
