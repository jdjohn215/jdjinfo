I'm a Research Fellow at the Marquette Law School's Lubar Center for Public Policy Research and Civic Education where I work on the [Marquette Law Poll](https://law.marquette.edu/poll/) and lots of other projects monitoring election, demographic, and housing trends in the Greater Milwaukee area specifically and Wisconsin generally.

This is my personal website. Opinions expressed here are mine alone and do not represent my employer. Here you'll find personal projects along with code and more detailed discussions from some of my day job projects.
